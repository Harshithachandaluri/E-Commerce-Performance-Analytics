**Project Objective:**

The primary objective of this project is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualise using a Power Bi dashboard on a comprehensive dataset from a global Superstore spanning four years. The Superstore, situated in the United States, specializes in retailing Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology products to a diverse customer base, including Consumers, Corporates, and Home Offices. The dataset encompasses `sales`,` profit`, and `geographical information`, providing valuable insights into the Superstore's operational performance and customer demographics.

**Business Questions**:

Which Category is Best Selling and Most Profitable?

What are the Best Selling and Most Profitable Sub-Category?

Which is the Top Selling Sub-Category?

Which Customer Segment is Most Profitable?

Which is the Preferred Ship Mode?

Which Region is the Most Profitable?

Which City has the Highest Number of Sales?


**Data Cleaning**:

1. Explored the dataset’s structure, including the number of rows and columns.
2. Cleaned the data and handled the  missing values,checked for any anomalies in the data.
3. Checked the data types of each column. Ensured they are appropriate for the analysis.
4. Calculated basic descriptive statistics for key numeric variables (e.g., sales, quantity).

**Recommednations:**

•	Focus on Office Supplies and  sub-category Binders,Papers and Furnishings as they are highest selling and most profitable. Bundle them with the less profitable products such as Bookcases, Table and Copiers to offset the losses.

•	Selling Bookcases and Tables result in huge losses, so Super Store has to consider to bundle them together with High Selling or Profitable sub-category such as Chairs, Copiers, Phones and Office Supplies products.

•	For Home Offices customers, these people might be busy with work and less likely to spend time selecting individual products, so create a Home Office package with products used for offices such as table, chairs, phone, copiers, storage, label, fasteners, bookcases.

•	For loss-making products like Supplies, Bookcases, Tables, consider to either drop these from the catalogue or change suppliers and bargain for cheaper price.

•	Consumer and Corporate Segment make up more than 70% of customerbase. Target them, especially customers from the East and West region in the Top 10 cities with Highest 
Sales by introducing special promotions and bundles for mass Consumer and Home Offices and send promotional emails or flyers.
